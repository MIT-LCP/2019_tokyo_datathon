With AdaBoost, we modified the data to focus on hard to classify observations. We can imagine this as a form of resampling the data for each new tree. For example, say we have three observations: A, B, and C, `[A, B, C]`. If we correctly classify observations `[A, B]`, but incorrectly classify `C`, then AdaBoost involves building a new tree that focuses on `C`. Equivalently, we could say AdaBoost builds a new tree using the dataset `[A, B, C, C, C]`, where we have *intentionally* repeated observation `C` 3 times so that the algorithm thinks it is 3 times as important as the other observations. Makes sense?\n",

As you can see, while this is a similar process to AdaBoost, the concept is quite different. Whereas before we aimed to iteratively improve our overall model with new trees, we now build trees on what we hope are independent datasets.\n",

This exact scenario is what bagging aims to replicate, except instead of actually going out and collecting new datasets, we instead use bootstrapping to create new sets of data from our current dataset.

        "While it is hard to express in this non-technical tutorial, the biggest innovation in gradient boosting is that it provides a unifying mathematical framework for boosting models. The approach explicitly casts the problem of building a tree as an optimization problem, defining mathematical functions for how well a tree is performing (which we had before) *and* how complex a tree is. In this light, one can actually treat AdaBoost as a \"special case\" of gradient boosting, where the loss function is chosen to be the exponential loss.\n",
